# FAQ
## Why the name "Fantomas"?
There are a few reasons to choose the name as such.
First, it starts with an "F" just like many other F# projects.
Second, Fantomas is my favourite character in the literature.
Finally, Fantomas has the same Greek root as "[phantom](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/phantom)"; coincidentally F# ASTs and formatting rules are so *mysterious* to be handled correctly.
