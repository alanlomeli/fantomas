# Style guide
TODO: Write a style guide page that explains why we are following https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/style-guide/formatting and https://github.com/G-Research/fsharp-formatting-conventions.

How the proposal process over at https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design#style-guide works.
How to contribute to the MS guide over at https://github.com/dotnet/docs.
(Example of that: dotnet/docs#30094)
